Organizations help teams and businesses collaborate, share gem ownership, manage permissions, and work together under a unified identity.

## What are Organizations?

Organizations provide a shared space for multiple users to collectively manage RubyGems. Instead of individual ownership, gems belong to the organization, making it easier to:

- **Maintain continuity** when team members change
- **Control access** with role-based permissions
- **Collaborate effectively** on gem development
- **Establish identity** for your company or project
