<em class="t-gray">How to build and install cryptographically signed gems-- and other security concerns.</em>

Security practices are being actively discussed. Check back often.

General
-------

Installing a gem allows that gem's code to run in the context of your
application. Clearly this has security implications: installing a malicious gem
on a server could ultimately result in that server being completely penetrated
by the gem's author. Because of this, the security of gem code is a topic of
active discussion within the Ruby community.

RubyGems has had the ability to [cryptographically sign
gems](http://docs.seattlerb.org/rubygems/Gem/Security.html) since version
0.8.11. This signing works by using the `gem cert` command to create a key
pair, and then packaging signing data inside the gem itself. The `gem install`
command optionally lets you set a security policy, and you can verify the
signing key for a gem before you install it.

However, this method of securing gems is not widely used. It requires a number
of [manual steps on the part of the developer](#building-gems), and there is no
well-established chain of trust for gem signing keys.  Discussion of new
signing models such as X509 and OpenPGP is going on in the [rubygems-trust
wiki](https://github.com/rubygems-trust/rubygems.org/wiki/_pages), the
[RubyGems-Developers
list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubygems-developers/lnnGTlfsuYo/TLDcJ2RPSDoJ)
and in [IRC](irc://chat.freenode.net/#rubygems-trust). The goal is to improve
(or replace) the signing system so that it is easy for authors and transparent
for users.

Using Gems
-------

Install with a trust policy.

  * `gem install gemname -P HighSecurity`: All dependent gems must be signed
    and verified.

  * `gem install gemname -P MediumSecurity`: All signed dependent gems must be
    verified.

  * `bundle --trust-policy MediumSecurity`: Same as above, except Bundler only
    recognizes the long `--trust-policy` flag, not the short `-P`.

  * *Caveat:* Gem certificates are trusted globally, such that adding a
    cert.pem for one gem automatically trusts all gems signed by that cert.

Verify the checksum, if available

    gem fetch gemname -v version
    ruby -rdigest/sha2 -e "puts Digest::SHA512.new.hexdigest(File.read('gemname-version.gem'))

Building Gems
-------

### Sign with: `gem cert`

1) Create self-signed gem cert

    cd ~/.ssh
    gem cert --build your@email.com
    chmod 600 gem-p*

- use the email address you specify in your gemspecs

2) Configure gemspec with cert

Add cert public key to your repository

    cd /path/to/your/gem
    mkdir certs
    cp ~/.ssh/gem-public_cert.pem certs/yourhandle.pem
    git add certs/yourhandle.pem

Add cert paths to your gemspec

    s.cert_chain  = ['certs/yourhandle.pem']
    s.signing_key = File.expand_path("~/.ssh/gem-private_key.pem") if $0 =~ /gem\z/

3) Add your own cert to your approved list, just like anyone else

    gem cert --add certs/yourhandle.pem

4) Build gem and test that you can install it

    gem build gemname.gemspec
    gem install gemname-version.gem -P HighSecurity
    # or -P MediumSecurity if your gem depends on unsigned gems

5) Example text for installation documentation

> MetricFu is cryptographically signed. To be sure the gem you install hasn't been tampered with:
>
> Add my public key (if you haven't already) as a trusted certificate
>
> `gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/metricfu/metric_fu/master/certs/bf4.pem)`
>
> `gem install metric_fu -P MediumSecurity`
>
> The MediumSecurity trust profile will verify signed gems, but allow the installation of unsigned dependencies.
>
> This is necessary because not all of MetricFu's dependencies are signed, so we cannot use HighSecurity.

-------

### Include checksum of released gems in your repository

    require 'digest/sha2'
    built_gem_path = 'pkg/gemname-version.gem'
    checksum = Digest::SHA512.new.hexdigest(File.read(built_gem_path))
    checksum_path = 'checksum/gemname-version.gem.sha512'
    File.open(checksum_path, 'w' ) {|f| f.write(checksum) }
    # add and commit 'checksum_path'

-------

### OpenPGP signing is [not recommended due to lack of support](http://www.rubygems-openpgp-ca.org/blog/nobody-cares-about-signed-gems.html).

For details, see discussion [with Yorick
Peterse](https://github.com/rubygems/guides/pull/70#issuecomment-29007487).

Reporting Security vulnerabilities
-------


### Reporting a security vulnerability with someone else's gem

If you spot a security vulnerability in someone else's gem, then you
first step should be to check whether this is a known vulnerability.
One way is by searching for an advisory on [RubySec](http://rubysec.com).

If this looks like a newly discovered vulnerability, then you should
contact the author(s) privately (i.e., not via a pull request or issue on a
public project) explaining the issue, how it can be exploited, and ideally
offering an indication of how it might be fixed.

### Reporting a security vulnerability with your own gem

First, request a [CVE
identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures)
by emailing [one of these
places](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO#how-do-i-request-a-cve).
This identifier will make it easy to uniquely identify the vulnerability when
talking about it.

Second, work out what people who depend on your gem should do to resolve the
vulnerability. This may involve releasing a patched version of your gem that
you can recommend they upgrade to.

Finally, you need to tell people about the vulnerability. Currently there
is no single place to broadcast this information but some good places to
start might be to:

- Send an email to several lists including ruby-security-ann@googlegroups.com,
  rubysec-announce@googlegroups.com, and oss-security@lists.openwall.com
  outlining the vulnerability, which versions of your gem it affects, and what
  actions those depending on the gem should take. Make sure to use a subject
  that includes the gem name, some short summary of the vulnerability, and the
  CVE ID if you have one.

- Add it to [ruby-advisory-db](https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/).
  You can do this by following the
  [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  guidelines and submitting a pull request.
