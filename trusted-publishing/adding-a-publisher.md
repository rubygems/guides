Adding a trusted publisher to a gem only requires a single setup step.

On [your profile page](https://rubygems.org/profile/me), click the link to any gem you'd like to configure.

If you're a gem owner, you'll see a link to "Trusted publishers" on the right side of the page. Click that link.

This will take you to the gem's trusted publishers page.

Click the "Create" button, which will take you to the publisher configuration page.

Providing the owner name, repository name, and GitHub Actions workflow name allows RubyGems to securely accept uploaded gems from the GitHub Actions infrastructure.
If you have multiple workflows that push gems, you can create one Trusted Publisher for each workflow.

The environment allows GitHub to constrain who can publish your gem if many people have access to the repository.
We suggest using the [GitHub Action Environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/using-environments-for-deploymentenvironment) name "release", which we will use in our workflow examples on the next page.

Once you click "Create Rubygem trusted publisher", your publisher will be registered and will appear in the list of trusted publishers for this gem.

Now, the `push.yml` workflow on `indirect/indirect-trusted-publishing` will be able to generate short-lived API tokens from RubyGems.org that are able to push to this gem.

A repo and workflow can be registered to multiple gems. For example, the `release.yml` workflow from the  `rails/rails` repo can be registered for both the `rails` and `activerecord` gems. Each gem can likewise allow multiple publishers, for example a single gem could allow both workflows `release-linux.yml` and `release-mac.yml`.

Now that you've created a Trusted Publisher, [create a GitHub Actions workflow](/trusted-publishing/releasing-gems) to publish your gem.
You can use [rubygem-await's release workflow](https://github.com/segiddins/rubygems-await/blob/main/.github/workflows/push_gem.yml) as a starting point.
