Move your gems from individual ownership to organization management for better collaboration and continuity. This guide covers the transfer process, requirements, and best practices.

## Before You Transfer

### Requirements

To transfer a gem, you need:

- **Owner permissions** on the gem
- **Admin or Owner role** in the target organization
- **MFA enabled** on your account

### Important Considerations

**Ownership changes are significant:**
- Individual owners lose direct gem access
- Organization members manage the gem based on roles
- The organization name appears as the gem owner
- Transfer cannot be reserved once completed

**Plan your transfer:**
- Notify co-owners before transferring
- Document the transfer for your team
- Update gem documentation with new ownership

## The Transfer Process

Transferring a rubygem to an organization works very similarly to creating a new organization. Follow these steps:

Navigate to the rubygems you want to transfer and click the **Transfer to Organization** link.

### Step 1: Select destination Organization

Select the organization you want to transfer your gem from the dropdown menu.

### Step 2: Invite Team Members

Add your collaborators to the Organization:

**Automatic Suggestions:** We'll suggest users who co-own your selected gems. This makes it easy to maintain existing collaborations.

**Existing Members:** If the user is already a member of the organization, they will show as
already being a member.

**Assign Roles:** Choose the appropriate role for each member:

- **Owner**: Full organization control
- **Admin**: Gem and member management
- **Maintainer**: Basic access and gem operations
- **Outside Collaborator**: Limited access, retains personal ownership of gems and is not a member of the orgnization

### Step 4: Confirm and Create

Review your organization setup:

- Organization name and handle
- Selected gems for transfer
- Invited members and their roles

Click **Transfer** to finalize the migration. You'll see:

- Your gem has been transferred to the selected organization.
- New members receive an email to join your Organization.
- You're redirected to your organization page
