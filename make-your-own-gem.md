Introduction
------------

Creating and publishing your own gem is simple thanks to the tools baked right
into RubyGems. Let’s make a simple “hello world” gem, and feel free to
play along at home! The code for the gem we're going to make here is up
[on GitHub](http://github.com/qrush/hola).

<a id="first-gem"> </a>
Your first gem
--------------

I started with just one Ruby file for my `hola` gem, and the gemspec.
You'll need a new name for yours (maybe `hola_yourusername`) to publish it. Check the Patterns guide for
[basic recommendations](/patterns/#consistent-naming) to follow
when naming a gem.

    % tree
    .
    ├── hola.gemspec
    └── lib
        └── hola.rb

Code for your package is placed within the `lib` directory. The convention is
to have *one* Ruby file with the *same* name as your gem, since that gets
loaded when `require 'hola'` is run. That one file is in charge of setting up
your gem's code and API.

The code inside of `lib/hola.rb` is pretty bare bones. It just makes sure that you
can see some output from the gem:

    % cat lib/hola.rb
    class Hola
      def self.hi
        puts "Hello world!"
      end
    end

The gemspec defines what’s in the gem, who made it, and the version of the gem.
It’s also your interface to [RubyGems.org](http://rubygems.org). All of the
information you see on a gem page
(like [jekyll](http://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll)’s) comes from the gemspec.

    % cat hola.gemspec
    Gem::Specification.new do |s|
      s.name        = 'hola'
      s.version     = '0.0.0'
      s.date        = '2010-04-28'
      s.summary     = "Hola!"
      s.description = "A simple hello world gem"
      s.authors     = ["Nick Quaranto"]
      s.email       = 'nick@quaran.to'
      s.files       = ["lib/hola.rb"]
      s.homepage    =
        'http://rubygems.org/gems/hola'
    end

> The description member can be much longer than you see in this example. If it
> starts with '==' then the description will be run through
> [RDoc's markup formatter](http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/RDoc/Markup.html) for display on
> the RubyGems web site. Be aware though that other consumers of the data might not
> understand this markup.

Look familiar? The gemspec is also Ruby, so you can wrap scripts to generate
the file names and bump the version number. There are lots of fields the
gemspec can contain. To see them all check out the full
[reference](/specification-reference).

After you have created a gemspec, you can build a gem from it. Then you can install
the generated gem locally to test it out.

    % gem build hola.gemspec
    Successfully built RubyGem
    Name: hola
    Version: 0.0.0
    File: hola-0.0.0.gem

    % gem install ./hola-0.0.0.gem
    Successfully installed hola-0.0.0
    1 gem installed

Of course, the smoke test isn’t over yet: the final step is to `require` the gem and use it:

    % irb
    >> require 'hola'
    => true
    >> Hola.hi
    Hello world!

> If you're using an earlier Ruby than 1.9.2, you need to start the
> session with `irb -rubygems` or require the rubygems library after
> you launch irb.

Now you can share hola with the rest of the Ruby community. Publishing your
gem out to RubyGems.org only takes one command, provided that you have an account on
the site. To setup your computer with your RubyGems account:

    $ curl -u qrush https://rubygems.org/api/v1/api_key.yaml >
    ~/.gem/credentials
    Enter host password for user 'qrush':

Once this has been setup, you can push out the gem:

    % gem push hola-0.0.0.gem
    Pushing gem to RubyGems.org...
    Successfully registered gem: hola (0.0.0)

In just a short time (usually less than a minute), your gem will be available for
installation by anyone. You can see it [on the RubyGems.org site](https://rubygems.org/gems/hola)
or grab it from any computer with RubyGems installed:

    % gem list -r hola

    *** REMOTE GEMS ***

    hola (0.0.0)

    % gem install hola
    Successfully installed hola-0.0.0
    1 gem installed

It’s really that easy to share code with Ruby and RubyGems.

<a id="more-files"> </a>
Requiring more files
--------------------

Having everything in one file doesn't scale well. Let's add some more code to
this gem.

    % cat lib/hola.rb
    class Hola
      def self.hi(language = "english")
        translator = Translator.new(language)
        translator.hi
      end
    end

    class Hola::Translator
      def initialize(language)
        @language = language
      end

      def hi
        case @language
        when "spanish"
          "hola mundo"
        else
          "hello world"
        end
      end
    end

This file is getting pretty crowded. Let's break out the `Translator` into a
separate file. As mentioned before, the gem's root file is in charge of
loading code for the gem. The other files for a gem are usually placed in a
directory of the same name of the gem inside of `lib`. We can split this gem
out like so:

    % tree
    .
    ├── hola.gemspec
    └── lib
        ├── hola
        │   └── translator.rb
        └── hola.rb

The `Translator` is now in `lib/hola`, which can easily be picked up with a
`require` statement from `lib/hola.rb`. The code for the `Translator` did not
change much:

    % cat lib/hola/translator.rb
    class Hola::Translator
      def initialize(language)
        @language = language
      end

      def hi
        case @language
        when "spanish"
          "hola mundo"
        else
          "hello world"
        end
      end
    end

But now the `hola.rb` file has some code to load the `Translator`:

    % cat lib/hola.rb
    class Hola
      def self.hi(language = "english")
        translator = Translator.new(language)
        translator.hi
      end
    end

    require 'hola/translator'

Let's try this out. First, fire up `irb`:

    % irb -Ilib -rhola
    irb(main):001:0> Hola.hi("english")
    => "hello world"
    irb(main):002:0> Hola.hi("spanish")
    => "hola mundo"

We need to use a strange command line flag here: `-Ilib`. Usually RubyGems
includes the `lib` directory for you, so end users don't need to worry about
configuring their load paths. However, if you're running the code outside of
RubyGems, you have to configure things yourself. It's possible to manipulate
the `$LOAD_PATH` from within the code itself, but that's considered an
anti-pattern in most cases. There are many more anti-patterns (and good patterns!)
for gems, explained in [this guide](/patterns).

If you've added more files to your gem, make sure to remember to add them to
your gemspec's `files` array before publishing a new gem! For this reason (among others),
many developers automate this with [Hoe](http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/hoe/),
[Jeweler](https://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler),
[Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/classes/Rake/GemPackageTask.html),
[Bundler](http://railscasts.com/episodes/245-new-gem-with-bundler), or
[just a dynamic gemspec
](https://github.com/wycats/newgem-template/blob/master/newgem.gemspec).

Adding more directories with more code from here is pretty much the same
process. Split your Ruby files up when it makes sense! Making a sane order for
your project will help you and your future maintainers from headaches down the
line.

<a id="adding-an-executable"> </a>
Adding an executable
--------------------

In addition to providing libraries of Ruby code, gems can also expose one or many
executable files to your shell's `PATH`. Probably the best known example of
this is `rake`. Another very useful one is `prettify_json.rb`, included
with the [JSON](http://rubygems.org/gems/json) gem, which formats JSON in a
readable manner (and is included with Ruby 1.9). Here's an example:

    % curl -s http://jsonip.com/ | \
      prettify_json.rb
    {
      "ip": "24.60.248.134"
    }

Adding an executable to a gem is a simple process. You just need to place the file in
your gem's `bin` directory, and then add it to the list of executables
in the gemspec. Let's add one for the Hola gem. First create the file
and make it executable:

    % mkdir bin
    % touch bin/hola
    % chmod a+x bin/hola

The executable file itself just needs a
[shebang](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/shebang.html) in order to figure out
what program to run it with. Here's what Hola's executable looks like:

    % cat bin/hola
    #!/usr/bin/env ruby

    require 'hola'
    puts Hola.hi(ARGV[0])

All it's doing is loading up the gem, and passing the first command line
argument as the language to say hello with. Here's an example of running it:

    % ruby -Ilib ./bin/hola
    hello world

    % ruby -Ilib ./bin/hola spanish
    hola mundo

Finally, to get Hola's executable included when you push the gem, you'll need
to add it in the gemspec.

    % head -4 hola.gemspec
    Gem::Specification.new do |s|
      s.name        = 'hola'
      s.version     = '0.0.1'
      s.executables << 'hola'

Push up that new gem, and you'll have your own command line utility published!
You can add more executables as well in the `bin` directory if you need to,
there's an `executables` array field on the gemspec.

> Note that you should change the gem's version when pushing up a new release.
> For more information on gem versioning, see the [Patterns Guide](/patterns/#semantic-versioning)

<a id="writing-tests"> </a>
Writing tests
--------------

Testing your gem is extremely important. Not only does it help assure you that
your code works, but it helps others know that your gem does its job. When
evaluating a gem, Ruby developers tend to view a solid test suite (or lack thereof)
as one of the main reasons for trusting that piece of code.

Gems support adding test files into the package itself so tests can be run
when a gem is downloaded. An entire community effort has sprung up called
[GemTesters](http://test.rubygems.org/) to help document how gem test suites
run on different architectures and interpreters of Ruby.

In short: *TEST YOUR GEM!* Please!

`Test::Unit` is Ruby's built-in test framework. There are
[lots](http://www.bootspring.com/2010/09/22/minitest-rubys-test-framework/) of
[tutorials](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/blob/master/README.txt) for
using it online. There are many other test frameworks available for Ruby as
well. [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) is a popular choice. At the end of the day,
it doesn't matter what you use, just *TEST*!

Let's add some tests to Hola. This requires adding a few more files, namely a
`Rakefile` and a brand new `test` directory:

    % tree
    .
    ├── Rakefile
    ├── bin
    │   └── hola
    ├── hola.gemspec
    ├── lib
    │   ├── hola
    │   │   └── translator.rb
    │   └── hola.rb
    └── test
        └── test_hola.rb

The `Rakefile` gives you some simple automation for running tests:

    % cat Rakefile
    require 'rake/testtask'

    Rake::TestTask.new do |t|
      t.libs << 'test'
    end

    desc "Run tests"
    task :default => :test

Now you can run `rake test` or simply just `rake` to run tests. Woot! Here's
a basic test file for hola:

    % cat test/test_hola.rb
    require 'test/unit'
    require 'hola'

    class HolaTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
      def test_english_hello
        assert_equal "hello world",
          Hola.hi("english")
      end

      def test_any_hello
        assert_equal "hello world",
          Hola.hi("ruby")
      end

      def test_spanish_hello
        assert_equal "hola mundo",
          Hola.hi("spanish")
      end
    end

Finally, to run the tests:

    % rake test
    (in /Users/qrush/Dev/ruby/hola)
    Loaded suite
    Started
    ...
    Finished in 0.000736 seconds.

    3 tests, 3 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips

    Test run options: --seed 15331

It's green! Well, depending on your shell colors. For more great examples, the best thing you can do is hunt around
[GitHub](https://github.com/languages/Ruby) and read some code.

<a id="documenting-code"> </a>
Documenting your code
---------------------

By default most gems use RDoc to generate docs. There are plenty of
[great tutorials](http://docs.seattlerb.org/rdoc/RDoc/Markup.html) for learning how
to mark up your code with RDoc. Here's a simple example:

    # The main Hola driver
    class Hola
      # Say hi to the world!
      #
      # Example:
      #   >> Hola.hi("spanish")
      #   => hola mundo
      #
      # Arguments:
      #   language: (String)

      def self.hi(language = "english")
        translator = Translator.new(language)
        puts translator.hi
      end
    end

Another great option for documentation is [YARD](http://yardoc.org/), since
when you push a gem, [RubyDoc.info](http://rubydoc.info/) generates YARDocs
automatically from your gem. YARD is backwards compatible with RDoc, and it
has a [good
introduction](http://rubydoc.info/docs/yard/file/docs/GettingStarted.md) on
what's different and how to use it.
